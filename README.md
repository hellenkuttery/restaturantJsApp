## Usage
Once the application is running, you can control the movement of the object using the following methods:

- **Keyboard Events:**
  - Press the **left arrow** key to move the object to the left.
  - Press the **right arrow** key to move the object to the right.


- **Mouse Events:**
  - Click on the ‚òù button to perform action shown in the gif.
  - Click on the üëá button to perform action shown in the gif.

## Implementation
The movement of the object is handled using React event listeners. Both keyboard and mouse events trigger actions that update the position or perform specific tasks related to the object.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript

## Note
- You have the flexibility to use different objects and enhance both the actions and the user interface according to your preferences and requirements.
